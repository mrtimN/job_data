# Data Jobs in Berlin
## What is the aim of this project?
This project is an approach to get deeper insights of the job market for data analyst positions in Berlin. 

## What data is being used? 
We are using a dataset from Kaggle, which was scraped from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). To enrich this dataset, we created functions to scrape a different job offer website: [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.de/)

Data you are using (and comments, main challenges, strengths & weaknesses, etcâ€¦)
Questions you want to answer (maybe divided by different topics). Each question should include a conclusion written in a markdown cell.
Describe the methodology you are using, explaining the steps you took for data cleaning, analysis, etc.
Conclusions after your analysis.
Further questions.
