# Data Jobs in Berlin

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the data job market in Berlin, exploring sector trends, job levels, and hiring practices. Insights are drawn from LinkedIn and StepStone datasets, enriched through web scraping.

## Data Sources
- **Primary**: LinkedIn job listings (Kaggle dataset).  
- **Enrichment**: StepStone job listings via scraping (~700 entries).

### Challenges:
- **Access Issues**: Bypassing StepStone's login to extract data like company size and applicants.  
- **Standardization**: Mapping diverse job titles and sectors into unified categories.  
- **Missing Data**: Imputation required for incomplete fields.

### Methods:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting.
2. **Web Scraping**: Used Python (`requests` & `curl_cffi`, `BeautifulSoup`) to extract additional data from StepStone.
3. **Categorization**: Standardized sectors and job levels for meaningful analysis.
4. **Analysis**: Explored trends in remote work, sector activity, and entry-level opportunities.

## Key Insights
- **Remote Roles**: More common in tech than healthcare or education.  
- **Entry-Level Jobs**: Abundant in IT and consulting sectors.  
- **Top Hiring Sectors**: IT, Finance, and Business Consulting lead in data job offers.

## Project Management
- **Tools**: Trello for task tracking; agile methods with milestone reviews.  
- **Strengths**: Communication, focus, and dedication.  
- **Improvements**: Better workload distribution for coding tasks.
